/**
 * A <code>JETAProperty</code> is the base class for all <i>custom</i> properties for a
 * Java bean. A custom property does more than simply hold a value.  They allow a JETABean
 * to add additional properties to a Java bean that are not defined in the BeanInfo.
 * JETAProperties can also have custom logic for setting the value on a bean as well
 * as versionable serialization. For example, some Swing components such as JTree and JList
 * are generally contained in a JScrollPane.  So a <i>scrollable</i> custom property was
 * created that allows the user to simply check or uncheck the scrollable behavior for these
 * components in the designer.  This is much easier than having to create a JScrollPane instance
 * on a form and manually adding a child component.  The scrollable property has the logic 
 * necessary to create the JScrollPane at runtime and add the underlying Java bean. 
 *
 * The following methods are invoked when a JETAProperty value is set on a bean:
 *  1. setValue    this updates this property with a new value if necessary.  
 *                 The property has the option of updating the bean here as well.
 *  2. updateBean  If needed, updates the associated bean with current property values.  
 *                 This is needed during initialization.  Not all properties need to
 *                 implement this method.
 * See: {@link com.jeta.forms.gui.beans.JETABean}
