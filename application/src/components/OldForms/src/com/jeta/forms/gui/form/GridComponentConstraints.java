/**
 * A <code>GridComponentConstraints</code> is a type of bridge to a live
 * CellConstraints in a FormLayout. The FormLayout always makes a clone of the
 * CellConstraints when returning them to a caller. This is very inefficient for
 * our needs since we need to get the CellConstraints on every repaint. Instead,
 * we use this class as a bridge and decouple ourselves from CellConstraints.
 * Currently, we use a modified FormLayout class that allows access to the
 * constraint map. This required a single line change to the FormLayout. We
 * could have used reflection to get this information, but this has implications
 * for WebStart applications.
 * 
 * @todo try to convince Karsten to provide effecient, public, read-only, access
 *       to the constraint map.
