/**
 * Base class for Swing component bean factories.  
 * This factory includes support for adding a scrollable property to
 * any Swing component.  This means that before the component is added
 * to a form, it is first added to a JScrollPane and the scroll pane is
 * added instead.  This occurs only if the scroll flag is set to true.
 * Many swing component factoriesn don't require this functionality, so they would
 * set the flag to false.  Other component factories such as JTree, JList, JTextArea
 * would set this flag to true.
 * 
 * Since the architecture only supports lightweight components, all factories 
 * will probably extend from this class.
