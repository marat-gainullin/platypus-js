/**
 * An iterator for a collection of Java Beans (java.awt.Component objects) contained by a FormPanel.
 * Only components that occupy a cell in the grid on the form are returned - not children of those
 * components. For example, if you have a Java Bean such as a calendar that has several child components, only 
 * the calendar instance will be returned. This iterator will not return the child components of that bean.
 * However, if a component is a nested form and this iterator is nested, then this iterator will return 
 * the components in the nested form (as well as the form itself).
 *
 * If an iterator encounters a nested form instance, that object will be returned (regardless of whether the 
 * nested flag is set).  A component is a nested form if it is an instance of a FormAccessor:
 *   <PRE>
 *     Iterator iter = formaccessor.beanIterator();
 *     while( iter.hasNext() )
 *     {
 *         Component comp = (Component)iter.next();
 *         if ( comp instanceof FormAccessor )
 *         {
 *             // found a nested form.
 *             // if this iterator is nested, the next call to <i>next</i> will
 *             // return components in the nested form.
 *         }
 *         else
 *         {
 *             // found a standard Java Bean
 *         }
 *     }
 *   </PRE>
 *
 * This iterator is fail-fast. If any components are added or removed by invoking the underlying FormAccessors
 * at any time after the Iterator is created, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
 * If nested is true, then the iterator will fail if components are added to <i>any</i> FormAccessor
 * in the form hierarchy.
 * You may safely call remove on the iterator if you want to remove the component from the form.
 * Note that you should not modify the underlying form container by calling the {@link java.awt.Container} methods
 * directly. This is not recommended and can also leave the form in an undefined state.
