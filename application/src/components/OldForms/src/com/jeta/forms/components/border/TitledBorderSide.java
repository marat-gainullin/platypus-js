 * A component that simulates the left or right side of a TitledBorder.  This component is

 * while allowing those components to stay in the same row or column of the form.  This
 * allows components to have the same x,y, width, or height, yet have differnt title borders.
 * This is not possible when using standard TitledBorder.
