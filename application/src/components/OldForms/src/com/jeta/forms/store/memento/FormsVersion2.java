 * This class is used to provide a version stamp to a forms file. This is not
 * the version of the forms designer product. Rather, this allows the runtime to
 * check the form file version. If this is an older runtime that is trying to
 * load a file stored with a more recent, incompatible runtime, an error message
 * can be displayed to the user. Incompatible changes should be marked by an
 * increase in the major version number. Changes to the minor and sub versions
 * should be reserved for bug fixes or changes that can be loaded and safely
 * ignored by older runtimes.
 * 
 * @deprecated. Use FormsVersion2
