/**
 * A FormAccessor is used to programmatically access and modify components on a form.<p>
 *
 * You should always use FormAccessors instead of modifying the underlying <tt>Container</tt> 
 * directly. The main reason is because the forms component hierachy may change in the
 * future.<p>
 * 
 * FormAccessors only modify the form they are associated with. A form can have nested forms, 
 * but FormAccessors do not access nested forms (except when using nested iterators).<p>
 * 
 * Be careful when using components that have implicit JScrollPanes.  The
 * designer allows you to set a <i>scroll property</i> for those components
 * that are scrollable (for example JTree, JTable, JList), and the forms runtime
 * automatically creates JScrollPanes for those components you specifiy as scrollable.  
 * When iterating over a container, implicit scroll pane instances will be returned rather
 * than the underlying Java bean for those scrollable components.<p>
 * 
 * FormAccessors provide direct access to the underlying FormLayout and its assciated
 * container. It is not recommended that you programmatically create CellConstraints
 * and change the layout using hard-coded column and row values.  The reason is because
 * it is very easy to modify the form using the Forms Designer.  Any modificiations
 * can break code that has hard-coded columns and rows. The best approach is to name all
 * of your components (including the scrollpanes) and access them by name whenever possible.
 * This applies to wizard-like GUIs as well.  It is recommended that in these cases,
 * you provide a dummy component on the form such as an empty JLabel.  You can then
 * replace the dummy component with another component at runtime (via <tt>replaceBean</tt> ).<p>

   /**
    * An iterator for a collection of Java Beans (java.awt.Component objects) contained by a FormPanel.
    * Only components that occupy a cell in the grid on the form are returned - not children of those
    * components. For example, if you have a Java Bean such as a calendar that has several child components, only 
    * the calendar instance will be returned. This iterator will not return the child components of that bean.
    * However, if a component is a nested form and the nested parameter is true, then this iterator will return 
    * the components in the nested form (as well as the form itself).
    *
    * If an iterator encounters a nested form instance, that object will be returned (regardless of whether the 
    * nested flag is set).  A component is a nested form if it is an instance of a FormAccessor:
    *   <PRE>
    *     Iterator iter = formaccessor.beanIterator();
    *     while( iter.hasNext() )
    *     {
    *         Component comp = (Component)iter.next();
    *         if ( comp instanceof FormAccessor )
    *         {
    *             // found a nested form.
    *             // if this iterator is nested, the next call to <i>next</i> will
    *             // return components in the nested form.
    *         }
    *         else
    *         {
    *             // found a standard Java Bean
    *         }
    *     }
    *   </PRE>
    *
    * The iterator is fail-fast. If any components are added or removed by invoking the underlying FormAccessors
    * at any time after the Iterator is created, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
    * If nested is true, then the iterator will fail if components are added to <i>any</i> FormAccessor
    * in the form hierarchy.
    * You may safely call remove on the iterator if you want to remove the component from the form.
    * Note that you should not modify the underlying form container by calling the <tt>Container</tt> methods
    * directly. This is not recommended and can also leave the form in an undefined state.  
    * @param nested if true, all components in nested forms will be returned.
    * @return an iterator to all the Java Beans in this container.
