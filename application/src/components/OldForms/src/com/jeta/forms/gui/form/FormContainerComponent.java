 * is a JTabbedPane.  A JTabbedPane is a StandardComponent in our architecture; however,
 * it is the only GridComponent besides a FormComponent that can have embedded forms as
 * children.  We have this specialized class for the sole purpose of propagating
 * gridcomponent events up the forms hierarchy when in design mode.
 * JSplitPanes are not currrently supported, but they would also be an example of
 * a FormContainerComponent.
